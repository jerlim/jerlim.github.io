      <description>The Singapore public health care system is managed by three healthcare clusters: National University Health System (NUHS), National Healthcare Group (NHG) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth). The patient information records are stored in each cluster’s private system silos, which unfortunately, do not share or communicate with each other.
For several years now, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working on a project to connect and exchange the patient data throughout the national health care systems.</description>

      <description>After pampering ourselves the previous weekend with the Language of Flowers afternoon tea, we decided to grab the high tea set from The Rose Veranda at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore last Sunday to end off a busy month of May.
Upon opening the box cover, you would unmistakeably recognize the eclectic pink theme for the high tea set, with the cardboard and various delicate pastries colour synced.
The high tea set includes:</description>

      <title>Prego @ Fairmont Singapore</title>

      <description>Located on the first floor of Fairmont Singapore, Prego is one of my favourite go-to places in town when I have cravings for Italian food. The restaurant décor is rustic Italian and guests enjoy natural lighting from the windows along the sides of it.
Earlier in May, we celebrated a friend&amp;rsquo;s birthday at Prego since he has never been there before and partly because I needed a pizza fix since California Pizza Kitchen closed during the Circuit Breaker last year.</description>

      <description>When I heard of a Fire &amp;amp; Ice Afternoon Tea - hot vs cold - it piqued my curiosity as to what type of savoury and sweet delights would be served.
Located away from the bustlings of the main hotel lobby, the Lobby Lounge, decked with dim lighting, comfy chairs and vibrant décor, is an excellent venue for mid-day chilling and indulging in an afternoon tea.
We opted for the five course afternoon tea set which comes with tea pairing for each course.</description>

      <description>In early May, Conrad Centennial Singapore launched a new floral themed afternoon tea - Language of Flowers, which includes a range of petite sweet bites and savoury delights. With the recently implemented Covid-19 restrictions, where dinning is prohibited, we decided to indulge ourselves and get a set to share on a lazy weekend.
I have always had high tea dining in the restaurants, this being the first time I am taking away a high tea set.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks back, when I chanced upon an Instagram story showcasing an adorable hedgehog shaped dessert at a new patisserie in Jalan Besar, I had to head over and see if it tastes as good as it looks.
La Vie was previously known as Reverie Patisserie, an online patisserie shop specialising in cakes and butter cookies.
The interior of the cafe is simple, consisting primarly of white and greys. The cafe walls are decked with paintings by local artists, doubling as a showroom for interested customer to purchase art pieces which they fancy.</description>

      <description>UNA, housed at level 2 of The Alkaff Mansion (an early 20th century bungalow), serves up Basque and Spanish fine-dining cuisine to guests. The Alkaff Mansion is surrounded by lush greenery, while heading up the flight of stairs, I cannot help but feel that I am being transported back in time to a colonial party.
The interior décor with its dark wood theme is warm and intimate, perfect for a romantic date.</description>

      <description>It has been 3 years since I last travelled to Hong Kong and I have always been a fan of bolo buns (菠萝包) with Kam Wah Cafe &amp;amp; Bakery listed in my HKG itineraries. Recently, when I heard of Champion Bolo Bun, a new modern concept 茶餐厅 (aka cafe) which opened along Tanjong Pagar, that exclusively sells bolo buns, I had to head down to sink my teeth into them while they are fresh out of the oven.</description>

      <title>Staycation @ The Westin Singapore</title>
      <link>https://jerlim.github.io/posts/2021/05/the-westin-singapore-staycation/</link>

      <description>Located within Singapore&amp;rsquo;s vibrant Marina Bay financial district, The Westin Singapore occupies level 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2. The Marriott property is a 5 minutes walk from Downtown MRT station, with Lau Par Sat a 10 minutes walk away to Telok Ayer. During the weekends, its surroundings are relatively quiet, with the lack of bustling office workers, perfect for leisure travellers and staycations.
The building has 2 sets of elevators, one which takes you from the ground level to the hotel lobby on the 32nd floor and the other which links the lobby to the guestrooms.</description>

      <title>The Spot @ Marina One</title>

      <description>Headed by Chef Lee Boon Seng, The Spot, serves fusion dishes which mix South East Asian flavours with European style cooking. Located in the CBD, is an ideal spot (pun intended) for holding mid-day lunch meetings or gatherings after work to unwind, chill and drink.
Although not a signature dish, the serving staff recommended us to start with their Cheese Bread - with unsalted butter &amp;amp; paprika sea salt. This savoury morsel, dense in the middle while light and chewy on the outside, is a delight to eat.</description>

      <description>Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.
Note: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.</description>

      <description>Well-known by local foodies as one of the best restaurants in the Singapore fine dining scene, Iggy&amp;rsquo;s is located in Hilton Singapore along Orchard Road and is in the 1* Michelin Guide Singapore, since 2017. The food served is primarily focused on seasonal Japanese ingredients they procure.
Dinner started with some bite-sized Snacks. A visual treat on your senses with mini sushi like potato cream balls with green curry and creamy uni (sea urchin)</description>
