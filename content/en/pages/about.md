Hello! This blog is created primarily to share the food and travel adventures of my journey through life, as well as to pen down my thoughts. Hence, I do not view myself as a food and travel critic/writer.

I grew up playing video/pc games, from Megaman on the NES, Streets of Rage (Bare Knuckle) on SEGA to Command & Conquer RTS on the PC. This love for gaming eventually had a huge influence on me, and I eventually pursued a degree in Computer Engineering (Computer Science) from the National University of Singapore.

During my graduation trip to Bangkok with my friends, I inevitably got bitten by the travel bug and always look forward to my next holiday adventure. Which explains my gravitation towards the Aviation/Hospitality (Travel) sector roles during my career in the IT industry.
