Well-known by local foodies as one of the best restaurants in the Singapore fine dining scene, Iggy's is located in Hilton Singapore along Orchard Road and is in the 1* Michelin Guide Singapore, since 2017. The food served is primarily focused on seasonal Japanese ingredients they procure.

Dinner started with some bite-sized **Snacks**. A visual treat on your senses with mini sushi like potato cream balls with green curry and creamy uni (sea urchin)

First course is **Cold Smoked Bonito** - dashi jelly, crispy leek, ginger oroshi. A very refreshing and appropriate *cold* dish to whet your appetite for the dishes to come.

The **Takenoko** - 8 gems oscietra caviar, sweet corn velouté, chive oil is pleasant with a hint of earthy sweetness.

Next up is **Risotto** - winter black truffles, parmigiano-reggiano, duxelle. They absolutely nailed the balance in this one, the truffles did not overpower the dish, it melded perfectly with the cheese, mushrooms and rice.

**Amadai** - kabura, chijimi horensou, plankton foam. A modern Japanese inspired dish which I felt is a tad sharp in *fishy* flavours and less balanced than the other dishes.

Soup before the mains came in the form of **Consomme Royale** - sudachi, razor clam, superior iberico broth. It is a visual delight as the broth is poured in front of you and the *flower blossoms* while bringing forth the aroma of the broth. It had a familiar comforting taste which is light on the palate.

One of the options for mains is the **Yamaguchi Wagyu** - koji cauliflower puree, shishito, jus. Althought Yamaguchi is more well known for their Fugu (Blowfish), the wagyu cut served is tender and bursting with umami that I really wished the portion is bigger.

The other choice for mains is **Duck Breast** - sansho, coriander, sunchoke purée, wild rice, pommery mustard. Although I preferred the wagyu, the pairing of the duck meat and the sides elevated the flavour profile of the dish, adding more complex layers and goodness in the mouth.<

Pre-dessert **palate cleanser** dish is soursop and yuzu ice shavings. Well executed and assisted to flushed down the *jelak-nous* of the main courses.

**Starwberry Shortcake** - mascarpone, lemons sponge, strawberry sorbet - is served for dessert. The flavours were very balanced on refreshing on the palate which I throughly enjoyed.

To end of the dinner, guests are offered a selection of **petit desserts** comprising macarons, madeleine, parline and jelly.

Overall, the food is exceptional albeit the price point. Service is impeccable and coupled with the cosy setting, is prefect for a romantic dinner date. If you have a Citi Prestige card and snag the Haute Dining deal, it is definitely worth the experience.
