Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.

*Note*: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird's eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.

While waiting for our food, we were served complimentary sourdough bread with porcini butter. The bread is warm and fluffy and paired well with the rich mushroom flavours from the butter.

We started off with 3 starters, first being the **Stuffed Shiitake** - pork, ginger, bacon mayo, katsuobushi. A decent Asian tasting dish.

Next is the **Irish Oysters** - apple, smoked dashi, wasabi which are plump and juicy.

Final starter is the signature **Crab Cake** - romanesco, chilli, daikon salad which is strong flavoured and packing umami goodness with each bite.

We ordered 4 different mains to share, starting with the **Free Range Chicken** - maitake mushroom tortellini, bourbon plum, soy peanut. While the chicken was tender and juicy, the pasta and wanton was the weakest link, perhaps left out too long before serving which resulted in a tougher, doughy texture.

Second main is the the **Westholme Wagyu, Flat Iron** - endive salad, Asian spice. We requested medium doneness and it was served perfectly pink without oozing blood. The fattiness in the steak made it a delight to eat along with the salad.

Next up the **Rhug Organic Lamb Rack** - lamb shoulder, caramelized cauliflower, curry spice. A visually colourful dish to whet the appetite. The meat was tender, flavourful and devoid of the gamey taste.

Last main ordered is the signature **Black Cod** - cooked in seaweed, green pea gnocchi, clam butter. The fish is soft and succulent, a well balanced dish with the only complaint being the portion being a tad too little.

To end off the evening, how could we not have desserts! First up, **Amber Peach** - honeycomb, cream fraiche, honey mochi, yogurt ice cream. I loved how the tartness of the yogurt blended with the peach and honey mochi. The honeycomb added an extra layer of texture to the whole experience.

The **William Pear** - confit, millefeuille soil, elderflower ice cream was decent. The bits of crunchy millefeuille elevated the dish which otherwise would be less complex.

Despite the portion for mains being slightly underwhelming, the food is refined. Service is generally prompt except when it is full house and the waiting staff forgot our request for cutlery. The ambience is top notch and ideal for a special date with your loved ones. They also have waiting staff who would come to your table to mix up a custom martini!
