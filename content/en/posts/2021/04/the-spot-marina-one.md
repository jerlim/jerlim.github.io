Headed by Chef Lee Boon Seng, The Spot, serves fusion dishes which mix South East Asian flavours with European style cooking. Located in the CBD, is an ideal spot (*pun intended*) for holding mid-day lunch meetings or gatherings after work to unwind, chill and drink.

Although not a signature dish, the serving staff recommended us to start with their **Cheese Bread** - with unsalted butter &amp; paprika sea salt. This savoury morsel, dense in the middle while light and chewy on the outside, is a delight to eat. It pairs well with the butter when consumed warm.

The **Pork Belly "Char Siu"** - Chinese BBQ, pickled mustard cucumber, mustard &amp; apple pur√©e - albeit on the oily side, is juicy, not overly sweet and oozing umami with each bite.

We ordered their signature **Glazed Local Duck Breast** - chrysanthemum flower honey glazed, plum ginger vinegar jus - and were not disappointed. The duck was done perfectly without any gamey taste and the ginger vinegar complemented the honey glaze wonderfully.

My favourite dish of the evening would be the **Asian Style Beef Shotrib** - barley cep porridge, pickled oyster mushroom, daikon, sweet &amp; sour glaze. Although the barley cep porridge flavour is on the heavier side, the beef shortrib is tender, with the right amount of fat and disintegrates in the mouth. Would definitely come back for this dish again.

From the delicious snack starters to the main dishes, everything we ordered hit all the right notes for me with the harmonious flavours. Also, the service was stellar, staff prompt and friendly.<

For those looking to get wine &amp; spirits, connected to The Spot is 1855 The Bottle Shop which offers a wide array of selection.
