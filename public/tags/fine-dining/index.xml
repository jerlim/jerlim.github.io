      <description>Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.
Note: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.</description>
