      <description>A couple weeks back, when I chanced upon an Instagram story showcasing an adorable hedgehog shaped dessert at a new patisserie in Jalan Besar, I had to head over and see if it tastes as good as it looks.
La Vie was previously known as Reverie Patisserie, an online patisserie shop specialising in cakes and butter cookies.
The interior of the cafe is simple, consisting primarly of white and greys. The cafe walls are decked with paintings by local artists, doubling as a showroom for interested customer to purchase art pieces which they fancy.</description>
