      <description>As Sofitel Singapore City Centre was converted to a Stay-Home Notices (SHNs) hotel during the dates we made our Accor Plus booking in Nov, we were offered the option of changing our staycation to Fairmont Singapore, which we opt-ed for.
At the time of our stay, the South Tower of the hotel was exclusively used for SHN. Thus, the Fairmont Gold lounge and newer suites located in the South Tower are unavailable for reservations.</description>
