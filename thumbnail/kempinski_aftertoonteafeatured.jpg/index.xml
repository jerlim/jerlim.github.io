      <description>When I heard of a Fire &amp;amp; Ice Afternoon Tea - hot vs cold - it piqued my curiosity as to what type of savoury and sweet delights would be served.
Located away from the bustlings of the main hotel lobby, the Lobby Lounge, decked with dim lighting, comfy chairs and vibrant d√©cor, is an excellent venue for mid-day chilling and indulging in an afternoon tea.
We opted for the five course afternoon tea set which comes with tea pairing for each course.</description>
