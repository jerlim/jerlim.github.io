      <description>Located on the first floor of Fairmont Singapore, Prego is one of my favourite go-to places in town when I have cravings for Italian food. The restaurant décor is rustic Italian and guests enjoy natural lighting from the windows along the sides of it.
Earlier in May, we celebrated a friend&amp;rsquo;s birthday at Prego since he has never been there before and partly because I needed a pizza fix since California Pizza Kitchen closed during the Circuit Breaker last year.</description>
