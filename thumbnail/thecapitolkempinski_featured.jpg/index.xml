      <description>Located a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw from City Hall MRT, The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore has 155 rooms occupying the Capitol Building and Stamford House. The property is located well within reach of malls like Raffles City, Funan, Suntec City, Marina Square and Bugis, extremely convenient for tourists and staycation guests.
The hotel lobby while small in area, feels classy and the check in process, while seated down on, was fuss-free. What made it feel special was the check-in staff would walk you to your room, feels like you are getting an escort VIP treatment or perhaps it is not too easy to navigate the halls on the upper levels if your room is located in a different wing.</description>
