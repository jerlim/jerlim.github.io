      <description>Opened in late 2021, Yuugo serves an eclectic fusion of Japanese and Western food, desserts, and coffee at affordable prices.
We ordered the Yuugo Wagyu Burger which came with uber crispy buns kind of like the type you find in Hong Kong. And to our plesant surprise, there was also melted cheese on the underside of the top bun. Absolutely delish!
Also, the Black Pepper Sirloin Steak Spaghetti was a good quality cut steak, served with balanced seasoning which made every bite enjoyable.</description>
