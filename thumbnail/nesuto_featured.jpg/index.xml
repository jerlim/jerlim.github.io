      <description>Nesuto is a small caf√© in Tanjong Pagar which offers a range of Japanese-French inspired desserts. The interior is simple and cosy, a good place for drinks or cakes if you happen to be nearby having a meal. This is actually my second visit to Nesuto, the first sometime last year after a meal around the area with a couple of friends.
We started off with the Summer Passion which consists of passionfruit mousse, banana compote with coconut creme on a coconut sablee with bits of coconut meringue on top.</description>
