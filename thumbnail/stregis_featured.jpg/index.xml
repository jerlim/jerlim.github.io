      <description>This year, I celebrated my birthday with a staycation at ** The St. Regis Singapore**. Located in the Tanglin district, the property is steps away from Orchard Road, as well as the Botanic Gardens. Do note that there no sheltered access to non-hotel food options (i.e. an umbrella or vehicle is required should it rain)
The check in area is on the left side of the lobby. At each check in desk, there are a couple of seats for guests to sit down while checking in concept similar to The Capitol Kempinski.</description>
