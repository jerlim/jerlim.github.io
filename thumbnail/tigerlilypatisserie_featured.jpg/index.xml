      <description>The newly opened Tigerlily Patisserie along Joo Chiat Road is the newest kid on the block to join the many new cafes springing up in the East Coast. Helmed by pastry chef Maxine Ngooi whose culinary journey involved stints at Les Amis and the now defunct Michelin-starred Vianney Massot Restaurant.
The botanical themed deco of the cafe has splashes of green and yellow, as well as terrazzo table tops. Do note that seating is limited with the safe distancing measures in place and their cakes are usually sold out in the early afternoon, sometimes even earlier on weekends.</description>
