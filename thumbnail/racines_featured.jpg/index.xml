      <description>Located at level five of Accor&amp;rsquo;s Sofitel Singapore City Centre, in Tanjong Pagar - Racines restaurant serves up French and Chinese cuisines.
The perimeter of the restaurant is surrounds by full glass panes which brings in lots of natural lighting and views of the surrounding landscape. The interior is spacious and chic with several sofa seats in the middle.
While waiting for our orders we were served some bread, nothing to shout about in terms of quality but still a nice touch to have.</description>
