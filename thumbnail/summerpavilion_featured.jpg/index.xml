      <description>Summer Pavilion is a popular 1-Michelin star restaurant located at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore which serves contemporary Cantonese cuisine. After reading about Chef Cheung Siu Kong&amp;rsquo;s repertoire of exquisite dishes in various blogs and reviews, we managed to snag the Haute Dining deal to check out for ourselves.
The interior is modern and cosy with elegant furnishings. After being ushered in and seated, the first thing one would notice is the pretty chinaware laid out before you!</description>
