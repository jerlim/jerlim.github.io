      <description>Located near Telok Ayer MRT, LUNA is a local patisserie offering artisanal cakes and baked confectionaries. A friend who worked in Raffles Place area recommended me to visit them as he knows I have a soft spot for desserts. And so, I headed down over a weekend with a couple of friends to check them out.
We started off with the most popular item on their menu, the Orh Nee Cake - vanilla sponge layered with yam ginkgo paste and yam cubes, topped with coconut Chantilly cream, white chocolate pearls and desiccated coconut.</description>
