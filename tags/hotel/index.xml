      <description>As Sofitel Singapore City Centre was converted to a Stay-Home Notices (SHNs) hotel during the dates we made our Accor Plus booking in Nov, we were offered the option of changing our staycation to Fairmont Singapore, which we opt-ed for.
At the time of our stay, the South Tower of the hotel was exclusively used for SHN. Thus, the Fairmont Gold lounge and newer suites located in the South Tower are unavailable for reservations.</description>

      <description>This year, I celebrated my birthday with a staycation at ** The St. Regis Singapore**. Located in the Tanglin district, the property is steps away from Orchard Road, as well as the Botanic Gardens. Do note that there no sheltered access to non-hotel food options (i.e. an umbrella or vehicle is required should it rain)
The check in area is on the left side of the lobby. At each check in desk, there are a couple of seats for guests to sit down while checking in concept similar to The Capitol Kempinski.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, some friends and I organized a staycation cum birthday celebration for a bestie at ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay (formerly the Marina Mandarin Singapore). After coming out of the level 4 lift towards the reception area, guests are greeted with lush greenery and bird cage like pavilions as they walk across the Atrium Sky Bridge.&amp;lt;
I stayed in a Lifestyle Room (33 to 35 sqm) which came with a city view.</description>

      <title>Staycation @ The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore</title>

      <description>Located a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw from City Hall MRT, The Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore has 155 rooms occupying the Capitol Building and Stamford House. The property is located well within reach of malls like Raffles City, Funan, Suntec City, Marina Square and Bugis, extremely convenient for tourists and staycation guests.
The hotel lobby while small in area, feels classy and the check in process, while seated down on, was fuss-free. What made it feel special was the check-in staff would walk you to your room, feels like you are getting an escort VIP treatment or perhaps it is not too easy to navigate the halls on the upper levels if your room is located in a different wing.</description>

      <description>After pampering ourselves the previous weekend with the Language of Flowers afternoon tea, we decided to grab the high tea set from The Rose Veranda at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore last Sunday to end off a busy month of May.
Upon opening the box cover, you would unmistakeably recognize the eclectic pink theme for the high tea set, with the cardboard and various delicate pastries colour synced.
The high tea set includes:</description>

      <title>Fire &amp; Ice Afternoon Tea @ Capitol Kempinski Hotel Singapore</title>

      <description>When I heard of a Fire &amp;amp; Ice Afternoon Tea - hot vs cold - it piqued my curiosity as to what type of savoury and sweet delights would be served.
Located away from the bustlings of the main hotel lobby, the Lobby Lounge, decked with dim lighting, comfy chairs and vibrant d√©cor, is an excellent venue for mid-day chilling and indulging in an afternoon tea.
We opted for the five course afternoon tea set which comes with tea pairing for each course.</description>

      <description>In early May, Conrad Centennial Singapore launched a new floral themed afternoon tea - Language of Flowers, which includes a range of petite sweet bites and savoury delights. With the recently implemented Covid-19 restrictions, where dinning is prohibited, we decided to indulge ourselves and get a set to share on a lazy weekend.
I have always had high tea dining in the restaurants, this being the first time I am taking away a high tea set.</description>

      <description>Located within Singapore&amp;rsquo;s vibrant Marina Bay financial district, The Westin Singapore occupies level 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2. The Marriott property is a 5 minutes walk from Downtown MRT station, with Lau Par Sat a 10 minutes walk away to Telok Ayer. During the weekends, its surroundings are relatively quiet, with the lack of bustling office workers, perfect for leisure travellers and staycations.
The building has 2 sets of elevators, one which takes you from the ground level to the hotel lobby on the 32nd floor and the other which links the lobby to the guestrooms.</description>
