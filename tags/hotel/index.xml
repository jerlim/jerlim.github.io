      <description>After pampering ourselves the previous weekend with the Language of Flowers afternoon tea, we decided to grab the high tea set from The Rose Veranda at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore last Sunday to end off a busy month of May.
Upon opening the box cover, you would unmistakeably recognize the eclectic pink theme for the high tea set, with the cardboard and various delicate pastries colour synced.
The high tea set includes:</description>

      <description>When I heard of a Fire &amp;amp; Ice Afternoon Tea - hot vs cold - it piqued my curiosity as to what type of savoury and sweet delights would be served.
Located away from the bustlings of the main hotel lobby, the Lobby Lounge, decked with dim lighting, comfy chairs and vibrant d√©cor, is an excellent venue for mid-day chilling and indulging in an afternoon tea.
We opted for the five course afternoon tea set which comes with tea pairing for each course.</description>

      <description>In early May, Conrad Centennial Singapore launched a new floral themed afternoon tea - Language of Flowers, which includes a range of petite sweet bites and savoury delights. With the recently implemented Covid-19 restrictions, where dinning is prohibited, we decided to indulge ourselves and get a set to share on a lazy weekend.
I have always had high tea dining in the restaurants, this being the first time I am taking away a high tea set.</description>

      <description>Located within Singapore&amp;rsquo;s vibrant Marina Bay financial district, The Westin Singapore occupies level 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2. The Marriott property is a 5 minutes walk from Downtown MRT station, with Lau Par Sat a 10 minutes walk away to Telok Ayer. During the weekends, its surroundings are relatively quiet, with the lack of bustling office workers, perfect for leisure travellers and staycations.
The building has 2 sets of elevators, one which takes you from the ground level to the hotel lobby on the 32nd floor and the other which links the lobby to the guestrooms.</description>
