      <description>Located within Singapore&amp;rsquo;s vibrant Marina Bay financial district, The Westin Singapore occupies level 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2. The Marriott property is a 5 minutes walk from Downtown MRT station, with Lau Par Sat a 10 minutes walk away to Telok Ayer. During the weekends, its surroundings are relatively quiet, with the lack of bustling office workers, perfect for leisure travellers and staycations.
The building has 2 sets of elevators, one which takes you from the ground level to the hotel lobby on the 32nd floor and the other which links the lobby to the guestrooms.</description>
