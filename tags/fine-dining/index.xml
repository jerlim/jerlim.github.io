      <description>Helmed by Chef Edward Chong, Peach Blossoms restaurant in ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay serves up aesthetically stunning fusion Chinese dishes which are as pleasing on the eyes as the palette. We did not have a chance to try them out during our staycation at the hotel earlier this year, and after the most recent P2HA was lifted, we managed to snag the Haute Dining deal to head down for a weekday dinner.</description>

      <description>Summer Pavilion is a popular 1-Michelin star restaurant located at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore which serves contemporary Cantonese cuisine. After reading about Chef Cheung Siu Kong&amp;rsquo;s repertoire of exquisite dishes in various blogs and reviews, we managed to snag the Haute Dining deal to check out for ourselves.
The interior is modern and cosy with elegant furnishings. After being ushered in and seated, the first thing one would notice is the pretty chinaware laid out before you!</description>

      <description>UNA, housed at level 2 of The Alkaff Mansion (an early 20th century bungalow), serves up Basque and Spanish fine-dining cuisine to guests. The Alkaff Mansion is surrounded by lush greenery, while heading up the flight of stairs, I cannot help but feel that I am being transported back in time to a colonial party.
The interior d√©cor with its dark wood theme is warm and intimate, perfect for a romantic date.</description>

      <description>Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.
Note: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.</description>
