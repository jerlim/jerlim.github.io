      <description>UNA, housed at level 2 of The Alkaff Mansion (an early 20th century bungalow), serves up Basque and Spanish fine-dining cuisine to guests. The Alkaff Mansion is surrounded by lush greenery, while heading up the flight of stairs, I cannot help but feel that I am being transported back in time to a colonial party.
The interior d√©cor with its dark wood theme is warm and intimate, perfect for a romantic date.</description>

      <description>Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.
Note: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.</description>
