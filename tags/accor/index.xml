      <description>During Christmas 2021, we used our second complimentary Accor Plus night to book Sofitel Singapore Sentosa. (first night used at Fairmont Singapore)
Check-in went smoothly and the lobby was mostly filled with families coming to stay in the resort and unwind as the year ends.
We were assigned a room in the Peace Wing and soaked in the clam relaxing resort atmosphere along the way. The resort compound&amp;rsquo;s landscape and gardens is inspired by Parisâ€™ Jardin du Luxembourg.</description>

      <description>As Sofitel Singapore City Centre was converted to a Stay-Home Notices (SHNs) hotel during the dates we made our Accor Plus booking in Nov, we were offered the option of changing our staycation to Fairmont Singapore, which we opt-ed for.
At the time of our stay, the South Tower of the hotel was exclusively used for SHN. Thus, the Fairmont Gold lounge and newer suites located in the South Tower are unavailable for reservations.</description>
