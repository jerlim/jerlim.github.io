      <description>Hambaobao started off as a food stall located at Beauty World food centre and closed down toward the end of 2019. It was opened by Ryan Wee and his wife Clare, and served Asian-inspired Artisanal Burgers at affordable prices.
Good news for those who&amp;rsquo;ve missed their burgers, as they are now back at their new air-conditioned shop within TRIO building along Sam Leong Road (five to ten minute walk from Farrer Park MRT Station).</description>
