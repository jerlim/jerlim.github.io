      <description>The Singapore public health care system is managed by three healthcare clusters: National University Health System (NUHS), National Healthcare Group (NHG) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth). The patient information records are stored in each clusterâ€™s private system silos, which unfortunately, do not share or communicate with each other.
For several years now, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working on a project to connect and exchange the patient data throughout the national health care systems.</description>
