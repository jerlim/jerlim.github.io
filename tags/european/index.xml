      <description>Headed by Chef Lee Boon Seng, The Spot, serves fusion dishes which mix South East Asian flavours with European style cooking. Located in the CBD, is an ideal spot (pun intended) for holding mid-day lunch meetings or gatherings after work to unwind, chill and drink.
Although not a signature dish, the serving staff recommended us to start with their Cheese Bread - with unsalted butter &amp;amp; paprika sea salt. This savoury morsel, dense in the middle while light and chewy on the outside, is a delight to eat.</description>

      <description>Located on level 70 of Swissotel The Stamford, SKAI (previously Equinox) serves up contemporary European food accompained by breath-taking skyline views of Singapore. When making a booking, I would recommended to specify whether you prefer a table along the windows or in the core area of the restaurant.
Note: While the full height windows provide an unblocked bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of either MBS or Singapore River, it may be glaring from afternoon sun.</description>
