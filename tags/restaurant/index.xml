      <description>Headed by Chef Lee Boon Seng, The Spot, serves fusion dishes which mix South East Asian flavours with European style cooking. Located in the CBD, is an ideal spot (pun intended) for holding mid-day lunch meetings or gatherings after work to unwind, chill and drink.
Although not a signature dish, the serving staff recommended us to start with their Cheese Bread - with unsalted butter &amp;amp; paprika sea salt. This savoury morsel, dense in the middle while light and chewy on the outside, is a delight to eat.</description>
